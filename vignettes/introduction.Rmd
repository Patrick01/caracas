```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r}
library(caracas)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
if (!have_sympy()) {
  # SymPy not available, so the chunks shall not be evaluated
  knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
}
```

## Road-map

Currently only a `SymPy` object is available. 
More functionality will be added shortly. 
Please keep an eye out at the development site at <https://github.com/r-cas/caracas>.

## Notes

* Python syntax is used, which means that there are a few differences to R's syntax:
  + Power is `**` not `^` (see below)

## Quick start

```{r}
sympy <- get_sympy()
```

```{r}
sympy$diff("2*a*x", "x")
sympy$solve("x**2 - 1", "x")
```

## More examples

Please find more examples in the other vignettes.
